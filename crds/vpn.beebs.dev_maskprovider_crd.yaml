            description: '[`MaskProviderSpec`] is the configuration for the [`MaskProvider`] resource, which represents a VPN service provider. It specifies a reference to a [`Secret`](k8s_openapi::api::core::v1::Secret) containing the credentials for connecting to the VPN service, as well as other important details like the maximum number of clients that can connect with the credentials at the same time.'

              maxSlots:
                description: Maximum number of [`MaskConsumer`] resources that can be assigned this [`MaskProvider`] at any given time. Used to prevent excessive connections to the VPN service, which could result in account suspension with some providers.

Even if the [`Mask`] expresses a preference for this provider in [`MaskSpec::providers`], it can only be assigned if it's in one of these namespaces. If unset, all [`Mask`] namespaces are permitted.

The contents of this `Secret` will be copied to the namespace of any [`MaskConsumer`] that reserves a slot with the provider. The created `Secret` is owned by the `MaskConsumer` and will automatically be deleted whenever the [`MaskConsumer`] is deleted, which happens when the provider is unassigned or the [`Mask`] itself is deleted.

                  Example values might be the role of the service (`"default"` or `"preferred"`), the service name (`"nordvpn"`, `"atlasvpn"`), or even region names (`"us-west"`, `"uk-london"`) - whatever makes sense for you.
