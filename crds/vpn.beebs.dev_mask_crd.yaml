              [`MaskSpec`] describes the configuration for a [`Mask`] resource, which is the mechanism for reserving slots with [`MaskProvider`] resources. The controller will create a [`MaskConsumer`] resource for each [`Mask`] that will be updated when it is assigned a [`MaskProvider`] and deleted whenever the provider is unassigned. This way any resources that consume the credentials can be garbage collected by using the [`MaskConsumer`] as an owner reference.

              Once a [`Mask`] is assigned a suitable provider, the controller copies the provider's credentials to a [`Secret`](k8s_openapi::api::core::v1::Secret) owned by the [`MaskConsumer`] and references it as [`AssignedProvider::secret`] within [`MaskConsumerStatus::provider`].
