# vpn-operator
Kubernetes operator for VPN sidecars written in pure [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

## Motivation
This operator simplifies the process of hiding your pods behind one or more VPN services. Instead of assigning the same exact VPN sidecar to every pod you want cloaked, you use the included `Provider` and `Mask` Custom Resources to automate credentials distribution across any number of VPN services.

## Installation
1. Apply the Custom Resource Definitions:
```bash
kubectl apply -f crds/
```
2. Install the vpn-operator helm chart:
```bash
# Create your chart configuration file.
cat <<EOF | echo "$(</dev/stdin)" > values.yaml
# In this example, we're enabled prometheus metrics
# for the controller but disabling PodMonitor creation.
# This is what you would want to do if your cluster
# has a custom method for scraping the pods' metrics.
# PodMonitor is a Custom Resource from kube-prometheus:
# https://github.com/prometheus-operator/kube-prometheus
prometheus:
  expose: true
  podMonitors: false
EOF

# Install the chart into the `vpn` namespace.
RELEASE_NAME=vpn
CHART_PATH=chart/
helm install \
  --namespace=vpn \
  --create-namespace \
  $RELEASE_NAME \
  $CHART_PATH \
  -f values.yaml
```

## Usage
1. Create a `Provider` resource and credentials `Secret` with your VPN credentials:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: my-vpn-credentials
  namespace: default
spec:
  stringData:
  # Environment variables for glueten, or however you
  # choose to connect to your VPN - this project makes
  # no prescription. The contents of this Secret will
  # be duplicated to the Mask's namespace when assigned.
  # Refer to https://github.com/qdm12/gluetun
    VPN_NAME: "my-vpn-name"
    VPN_USERNAME: "myusername"
    VPN_PASSWORD: "mypassword"
---
apiVersion: vpn.beebs.dev/v1
kind: Provider
metadata:
  name: my-vpn
  namespace: default
  labels:
  # You can optionally specify a label so that Masks
  # have the ability to select this service at the
  # exclusion of others.
    vpn.beebs.dev/provider: my-example-vpn-label
spec:
  # In this example, the contractual terms with the
  # VPN service only allows five devices to be active
  # simultaneously. This field is mandatory. You
  # shouldn't attempt to create an unlimited number
  # of connections. Always set it to sane value for
  # your purposes. 
  maxSlots: 5

  # Corresponds to the above Secret resource.
  secret: my-vpn-credentials
```

2. Make sure the `Provider` enters the `Active` phase:
```bash
kubectl get provider -Aw
```

3. Create `Mask` resources to reserve slots with the `Provider`:
```yaml
apiVersion: vpn.beebs.dev/v1
kind: Mask
metadata:
  name: my-mask
  namespace: default
spec:
  # You can optionally require the Mask be assigned
  # specific Providers. These value will correspond
  # to Providers' metadata.labels["vpn.beebs.dev/provider"]
  #providers: [my-example-vpn-label]
```

4. Wait for the `Mask`'s phase to be `Active` before using it:
```bash
kubectl get mask -Aw
```

5. The `Mask` contains a reference to the VPN credentials Secret created for it at `status.provider.secret`. Plug these values into your VPN containers (e.g. [gluetun](https://github.com/qdm12/gluetun)).

## Scaling
While the controller code is fully capable of concurrent reconciliations, scaling is not as simple as increasing the number of replicas in the deployments. I have ideas for how to scale horizontally, so please open an issue if you encounter problems scaling vertically. This can done by adjusting your `values.yaml` file:
```yaml
controllers:
  masks:
    resources:
      limits:
        memory: 192Mi
        cpu: 400m
  providers:
    resources:
      limits:
        memory: 192Mi
        cpu: 400m
```

## Notes
### Custom Resource Definitions
The CRDs are generated by [kube-rs](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube) and include their comments from the [surrounding code](types/src/types.rs). You can view the field descriptions with `kubectl`:
```bash
kubectl get crd providers.vpn.beebs.dev -o yaml
kubectl get crd masks.vpn.beebs.dev -o yaml
```

### Waiting phase
If no slots are available, the phase of the `Mask` will be `Waiting`. If you are writing a controller that creates `Mask`s for your custom resources, you may consider adding an equivalent `Waiting` phase to your custom resource to show it's waiting on a VPN slot to become available.

### Garbage collection
Your application is responsible for monitoring the status of your `Mask` and killing the pod if the provider is changed or unassigned. Failing to do so may result in creating more connections than afforded by a `Provider`'s `spec.maxSlots`.

Note: Some VPN services like SurfShark reserve the right to ban you for abusing their generous "unlimited devices" policies. In such cases, it's recommended to use a relatively low `spec.maxSlots` for the `Provider`.
